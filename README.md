# Welcome to the NeruvyMC!

I am excited to make a new Minecraft server that actually has **functional and working mods**! This server is a **Lifesteal Server** and for Lifesteal servers, **if you die, you lose a heart, and if you kill a player, you gain a heart, and if you run out of hearts, you're banned**. And for the most part, **you shouldn't trust anyone on this server unless you know them well** (from my past experiences in Lifesteal servers)

**NOTE: Don't expect the fastest server, this is a server that I'm running off of my own pc, which doesn't have the highest specs.**

Now that the introduction is out of the way, here are the rules;

**Gameplay Rules**
---
- Disallowed Mods: Radar, freecam, macros, auto-clickers (except for farming), health indicators.
- No hacked clients, mods, or scripts that provide unfair advantages.
- No abuse of bugs or glitches. Report bugs instead of exploiting them.
- No item duplication or use of duped items.
- No alt account farming or using alts to gain extra hearts, kills, or advantages.
- No staff impersonation.
- No finding or using the world seed.
- Limit of 2 alt accounts per player.

**Chat Rules**
---
- No spamming or flooding the chat.,
- No harassment or hate speech, including racism, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- No real-life threats. All threats, whether serious or joking, will- be taken seriously.
- No inappropriate discussions (NSFW, drugs, self-harm).
